# OceanCodingChallenge
This is Nicolas Risso's submission for the Advancement Design coding challenge.

Implementations:

- Water simulated with Gerstner and Circular Waves.
- Waves generated using Gradient Noise.
- Water exhibits Post Process effects when submerged, with a visible waterline when not completely underwater.

Difficulties:

- The waterline experiences glitches and does not perfectly align with the wave noise, resulting in small imperfections. This is likely caused by the scaling of the ocean.
